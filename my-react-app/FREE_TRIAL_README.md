## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js)

#### Endpoints

- `POST /free-trial/start` - Creates a new trial session
- `GET /free-trial/questions` - Returns trial questions (filtered by type)
- `POST /free-trial/quiz-sessions` - Records trial quiz sessions
- `POST /free-trial/question-attempts` - Records individual question attempts

#### Data Storage

- **In-Memory Storage**: Trial sessions stored in `Map` for quick access
- **Fixed Questions**: 40 predefined questions in `FREE_TRIAL_QUESTIONS` array
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Inactive sessions removed after 1 hour

#### Trial Questions

```javascript
const FREE_TRIAL_QUESTIONS = [
  // 10 Surgery questions
  // 10 Medicine questions
  // 10 Pediatric questions
  // 10 Obstetrics & Gynecology questions
];
```

3. **Separate Analysis**: Trial data processed in dedicated `TrialAnalysis` component
4. **Cleanup**: Data removed from sessionStorage after analysis viewing

const isTrial = id && id.startsWith("trial_");
```

#### Routing

- **Activity Tracking**: Last activity timestamp for cleanup
- **Memory Efficient**: In-memory storage with automatic cleanup

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables required for trial functionality.

### Customization

- **Question Count**: Modify `FREE_TRIAL_QUESTIONS` array
- **Session Duration**: Change cleanup interval in backend
- **UI Messages**: Update trial-specific text in components
- **Contact Links**: Modify WhatsApp URLs in components

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Trial Start**: Verify trial session creation
2. **Quiz Taking**: Test quiz functionality with trial questions
3. **Trial Analysis**: Verify separate trial analysis page works correctly
4. **Normal Analysis**: Verify normal analysis page is completely unaffected
5. **Data Cleanup**: Test automatic session cleanup
6. **Error Handling**: Test missing trial data scenarios

### Manual Testing

1. Start free trial from landing page
2. Take a quiz with trial questions
3. View results and navigate to trial analysis
4. Verify normal analysis page still works for regular users
5. Verify trial data cleanup after 1 hour

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Separation**: Trial functionality doesn't affect normal accounts at all
- **No Interference**: Normal analysis page works exactly as before
- **Isolated Testing**: Trial features can be tested independently
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes to trial features don't risk breaking normal functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- **Trial Limits**: Limit number of trial sessions per IP
- **Analytics**: Track trial conversion rates
- **Personalization**: Customize trial questions based on user behavior
- **Social Sharing**: Allow trial users to share results
- **Email Capture**: Optional email collection for follow-up

### Scalability Considerations

- **Database Storage**: Move to Redis or database for production
- **CDN Integration**: Serve trial questions from CDN
- **Caching**: Implement caching for trial questions
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute trial sessions across servers
